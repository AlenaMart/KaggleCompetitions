What to do:

Delete MSSubclass - duplicate HouseStyle and YearBuilt 
MSZoning - corelates with Neighbourhood?
LotFrontage - corr with LotArea and 1stFlrSF, less significant
LotArea - outliers
Street - almost everything is the same
Alley - not a lot of alleys. Combine with street to grvl_access
LotShape, LandContour, LandSlope - to one featutre
Utilities - maybe useless
LotConfig
Neighbourhood
Condition1 & 2 - to one feature
BldgType
HouseStyle
OverallQual
YearBuilt
YearRemodAdd - to feature WasRemodeled?
RoofStyle - doesn't really matter
RoofMatl - wood is more expensive
BsmtFinType1 - Only good quality matters
BsmtFinType2 & SF2 - doesn't matter

1stFlrSF & 2nd - again about stories
Baths - sum

Depend on year try to classify houses
